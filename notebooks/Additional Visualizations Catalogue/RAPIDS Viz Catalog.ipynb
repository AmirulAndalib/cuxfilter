Datashader breaks the creation of images into a series of explicit steps that allow computations to be done on intermediate representations. This approach allows accurate and effective visualizations to be produced automatically without trial-and-error parameter tuning, and also makes it simple for data scientists to focus on particular data and relationships of interest in a principled way.\n",
    "- The computation-intensive steps in this process are written in ordinary Python but transparently compiled to machine code using Numba and flexibly distributed across CPU cores and processors using Dask or GPUs using CUDA. This approach provides a highly optimized rendering pipeline that makes it practical to work with extremely large datasets even on standard hardware, while exploiting distributed and GPU systems when available.\n",
