### Where is the original cuXfilter and Mortgage Viz Demo?
The original version (0.1) of cuXfilter, most known for the backend powering the Mortgage Viz Demo, has been moved into the `/javascript` folder. As it has a much more complicated backend and javascript API, weâ€™ve decided to focus more on the streamlined notebook focused version in the `/python` folder.

## Future Work
cuXfilter python development is in early stages and on going. See what we are planning next on the [projects page](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuxfilter/projects).
